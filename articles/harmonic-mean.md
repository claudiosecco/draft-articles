# How to choose between harmonic or arithmetic mean
## Introduction
In many cases the use of the arithmetic mean (weighted or not) is misplaced, when the correct choice would be the use of the harmonic mean. I intend to show a very simple way to choose between the two, in a very pratical way. I do not intend to write complete article about the statitcal subject of means.

## Case: $ per invoice
Consider an enterprise that have three clients:

| Client | Revenue | # invoices | $ / invoice |
| :----: | ------: | ---------: | ----------: |
| A      | 15.000  | 30         | 500         |
